# Carbon Spice

Carbon spice is an attempt to create a colorscheme that has good contrast and
readability along with meaningful highlights for code editing.

It is based on [IBM's design
language](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/color/) and inspired by
[Oxocarbon](https://github.com/shaunsingh/oxocarbon.nvim).

The codebase is based off of Mofiqul's [vscode
theme](https://github.com/Mofiqul/vscode.nvim). I wanted something in lua that
was easy to modify and it ticked all those boxes for me. 

I have previously created some vim/neovim colorschemes but they never stuck
(neither did any other themes). I always found inconsistencies and nitcpicks,
usually because too many things were being colored on my screen. The
approach I took this time is create new colors and gradually replace the
originals. For syntactic elements, if I am unsure of what color to assign I
have assigned white and will revisit if it looks odd when editing specific
pieces of code.

This is very much a Work In Progress and there will be many inconsistencies to
start with.
